### WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLOCKCHAINS AND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE, TWO OR THREE BLOCKCHAIN PACKAGES ⁉️

In this post I'll explain the difference between blockchains and the difference between the packages we offer for purchase

There are currently 3 blockchains available in the program:

📶 BITCOIN: not many wallets, but they can be very large since the bitcoin exchange rate is very high, and if 10 years ago 1 bitcoin was not worth anything, now it can be dozens or thousands of dollars!

🔹 ETHEREUM: Popular cryptocurrency, it finds more wallets, but they can be small, the advantage of Ethereum blockchain is that it has a very big amount of other coins, and besides ETH we can find other coins, like dogecoin, shiba etc.

🪙 LITECOIN: The advantage of this blockchain is low commissions and it is not rare to find good wallets, in general it is an old blockchain and there are a lot of forgotten wallets

All three blockchains are great 💰

What's the difference between software subscriptions:

1️⃣ One blockchain - this means you can choose any blockchain from those available, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin.

2️⃣ Two blockchains - this means that you choose any 2 blockchains in which software will search for coins, any blockchain of your choice!

3️⃣ Three blockchains - this means you’ll get all available blockchains for wallet search. Full Subscription! Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin all these blockchains will be available in your wallet search software!

How many blockchains to buy is only up to you
